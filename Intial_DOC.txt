Make up your mind

The idea is to help people make up their minds by comparing the attributes of the options available to them,
helping the user select the best option with a well informed decision.

steps:
	choose a title
	create an option, min 2 max 5
	add fields or attributes applicable for all options (title/description only at this point)
		a field should always have a 'not applicable' option
	fill values for the fields for each option (option and field view only to help the user focus on one option)
		the user can add or delete a field.
		deleting a field will delete all field values from the other options already set at this point
		when adding a field the user can already set a value for the new field, as well as for the other options (with the same field value)
		when adding a field the user will be asked if he wants to set 'not applicable' for the other options

	push start! ponder over your choices and select the best option with an educated choice

	options are displayed horizontally on web, on mobile its' horizontally scrolling
	users can change add or delete field or field values 
	users can upvote/downvote options or delete(not really, more of like hide it) an option completely from the deck as many times as they want
	users can choose between modes: point system or rising system
	the options display it's points on each option box depending on how many votes an option have
	the options will be ranked according to their points in the ranking box
